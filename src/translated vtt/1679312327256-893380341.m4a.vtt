Can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Of course Reem, I love this kind of dialogue.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Arabic language appeared many years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Historians pointed out that it is one of the most prominent languages,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and it is the oldest group of languages in the world.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Why is learning the Arabic language difficult?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It is not like that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The diversity of Arabic language sciences,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
such as literature, communication, grammar, grammar,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
beauty, expression, and multiple singularities,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it only requires determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This name is re-used in the Arabic language,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because it is the only language in the world that contains the letter of the opposite.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I see you always get high marks in the Arabic language,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and the teacher describes you as a lover of the Arabic language.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Why?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The Creator has honored it,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it is the main language of Islam,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Thank you, Mona.
