The Arabic Language

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.520
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.140
Of course Reem, I love this type of conversation.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.180
Okay, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.040
The Arabic language has appeared for many years.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.580
Historians have pointed out that it is one of the most popular languages,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.300
and it is the oldest group of languages in the world.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.660
Why is learning the Arabic language difficult?

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.240
It is not like that.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.740
Rather, the diversity of Arabic language sciences,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.740
between literature and communication,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.120
grammar and grammar,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.120
beauty and expression,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
and multiple singularities,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.240
make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.580
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.700
it only needs determination and persistence to learn and perfect it.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.320
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.620
This name is re-released on the Arabic language,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.240
because it is the only language in the world that contains the letter of the opposite.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.240
I see you always get high marks in Arabic,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.240
and the teacher describes you as a lover of the Arabic language.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Why?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.240
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.240
The Creator has honored it,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.240
and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.240
and it is the main language of Islam,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.240
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:18.240
Thank you, Yamuna.
