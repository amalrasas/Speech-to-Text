The Arabic Language

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:12.560
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.120
Of course Reem, I like this kind of conversation.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.140
Good, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.880
The Arabic language appeared many years ago.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.880
Historians pointed out that it is one of the most important languages, and it is the oldest language in the world.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.880
Why is learning the Arabic language difficult?

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.880
It is not like that.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.880
The diversity of Arabic languages, such as literature, rhetoric, grammar, grammar,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.880
beauty, expression, and multiple singularities, make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.880
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.880
it only requires determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.880
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.880
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.880
This name is re-used in the Arabic language,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.880
because it is the only language in the world that contains the letter of the opposite.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.880
I see you always get high marks in the Arabic language,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.880
and the teacher describes you as a lover of the Arabic language.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.880
Why?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
How can I not love it?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.880
The Creator has honored it, and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.880
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.880
which is the main language of Islam and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.880
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:11.880
Thank you, Yamuna.
