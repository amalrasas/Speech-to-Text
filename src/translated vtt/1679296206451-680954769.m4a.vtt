My dear friend Mooda, can I know your opinion in certain points related to Arabic

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.880
My dear friend Mooda, can I know your opinion in certain points related to Arabic

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.520
Of course Reem, I love this kind of conversation

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.780
Well, when did Arabic appear?

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.060
Arabic appeared many years ago

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.060
The historians pointed out that it is one of the most prominent languages, and it is the most advanced language in the world.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:58.060
It is not like that. The diversity of Arabic language sciences, including literature, communication, grammar, grammar, beauty, expression, and multiple singularities, make some people afraid of learning them, while they are one of the strong and easy languages to learn.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.060
But they only need determination and persistence to learn and master them.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.060
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the Dada language?

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:20.060
Yes, of course. This name is re-released on the Arabic language, since it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world that contains the letter Dada.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.060
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.060
And the teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic. Why?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:48.060
How can I not love it? The Creator has honored it and made it the language of the Holy Quran and the language of the Master of Messengers, which is the main language of Islam and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:02:00.060
How beautiful is the Arabic language! Thank you, Mona.
