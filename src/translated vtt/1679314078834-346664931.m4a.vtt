My dear friend Muna, can I ask for you opinion on some points in the Arabic language?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Naturally Reem. I like this type of conversations.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Good. When was the time the French language first became known?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Arabic for English was first known many years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The historians pointed out that it is one of the most prominent languages, and it is the most advanced language in the world.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is not the case. The diversity of Arabic language sciences, including literature, communication, grammar, grammar, beauty, expression, and multiple vocabularies, make some people afraid of learning them, while they are one of the strong and easy languages to learn.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But they only need determination and persistence to learn and master them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the Dada language?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yes, for sure. This name is re-released on the Arabic language, since it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world that contains the letter Dada.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And the teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic. Why?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:49.000
How can I not love it? The Creator has honored it and made it the language of the Holy Quran and the language of the Master of Messengers, and it is the main language of Islam and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:04.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language! Thank you, Mona.
