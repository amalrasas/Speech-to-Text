00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
Muna

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it is the group of the oldest languages in the world

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It is not like that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but the diversity of Arabic language sciences

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
between literature and communication

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and grammar and grammar

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the beauty of the cities and the expression

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the multiple singularities

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
make some people afraid of learning them

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
while they are one of the strong and easy languages to learn

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but they need determination and persistence to learn and perfect them

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you know why Arabic is called the language of the deaf?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, of course

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This name is re-used on Arabic

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because it is the only language in the world

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that contains the letter of the deaf

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Why?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The Creator has honored it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and made it the language of the Holy Quran

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the language of the Prophet

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it is the main language of Islam

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and the cradle of civilizations around the world

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Thank you, Mona
