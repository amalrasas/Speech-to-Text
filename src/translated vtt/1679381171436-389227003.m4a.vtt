00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Arabian language

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.520
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.360
Of course Reem, because I like this kind of conversation.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.200
Ok, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.100
The Arabic language appeared many years ago.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.800
Historians pointed out that it is one of the most famous languages,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.800
and it is the oldest group of languages in the world.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Why is learning the Arabic language difficult?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.100
It is not like that.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
The diversity of Arabic language sciences,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.100
such as literature, communication, grammar, grammar,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.300
beauty, expression, and multiple singularities,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.300
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.300
it only needs determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.300
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
This name is re-released on the Arabic language,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.300
because it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
that contains the letter of the opposite.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.300
I see you always get high marks in the Arabic language,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.300
and the teacher describes you as a lover of the Arabic language.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.300
Why?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
The Creator has honored it,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.300
and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.300
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
and it is the main language of Islam,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.300
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
What a beautiful Arabic language!

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Thank you, Yamuna.
