One year later

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.760
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on certain aspects of the Arabic language?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.880
Naturally, Reem as I love this kind of dialogue

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.840
Good! When did the UAE appear?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.840
Arabic has been a very popular language for many years.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.840
Historians have pointed out that it is one of the most popular languages,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840
and it is the oldest collection of languages in the world.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.840
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.840
It is not like that.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
The diversity of Arabic language sciences,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
including literature, communication, grammar, grammar,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.840
beauty, expression, and multiple singularities,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.840
make some people afraid of learning it,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.840
while it is one of the strongest and easiest languages to learn.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.840
But it only requires determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.840
Do you know why Arabic is called the language of pressure?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.840
Yes, of course.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.840
This name is re-released on Arabic,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.840
because it is the only language in the world that contains the letter D.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.840
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.840
And the teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.840
Why?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.840
How can I not love it?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
The Creator has honored it,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.840
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
which is the main language of Islam,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.840
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.840
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:11.840
Thank you, Yamuna.
