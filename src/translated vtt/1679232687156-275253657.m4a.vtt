00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
A poem

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the right thing to do.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Worries are like a sword,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and diseases are like a dagger.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The red of evidence,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
no matter how much you care.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If you complain to those who have a good time,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
your eyes will boil,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and those you complain to will be sad.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And if you complain to those who complain to you,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you make them happy.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You add a wound to your wound,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and it's called regret.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Did the media one day free your country?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Or is torture an alternative to death?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Whoever has luck,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
turns off his eyes of concern.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Luck has no eyes if you don't see its eyes.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
How many have I betrayed,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
with whom I gave him my trust,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and forced me to leave him in distress.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
How many have I become a bridge for those I loved,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and he walked on my shoulders,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and how many have I trampled on his feet,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and he broke my heart.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the heart was his home,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and with the death of a weakling,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
it has no value.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Neither the despair of my clothes,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
nor the diseases break me.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Neither the despair of my clothes,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
nor the sorrows break me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
My wound is stubborn,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and the fire is burning.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Drink your tears,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
drink your tears,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and drink once honey.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The candles are burning,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and they are smiling.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And stick your nose,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and rub its back with a brush,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and be like a sword,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
if the shields are broken.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The justice of the earth is in the hands of the Lord,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and the justice on earth is not justice,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
nor is it a sin.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So good is a carrier,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and a seller.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Good is a destroyer,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and evil is a wolf,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and all the devils

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
are running around

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to reassure the wolf

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that the sun is not set.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Be a beast,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and be a lion without a hand.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You see the delicacies under your hands,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you are full.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So the money is a gift,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
like gold.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It has what the nations pray for in all their languages,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and the strong ones are the tyrants.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It is a pharaoh,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and most people are under its throne.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So be a servant to Allah.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Your complaint is my complaint.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
O you who are full of pain,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
their blood did not flow on the mountains,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
their blood flowed.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And who is but Allah,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
we are strong under his chest,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and we seek help from him.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And we hold on.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Be a philosopher.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You see that everyone here

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is fighting against a non-existence,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and they are non-existent.
