00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Do I know your opinion of the Arabic language?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Of course Reem, I love this kind of dialogue.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The Arabic language has appeared many years ago.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Arabic has been a very long time

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and historians pointed out that it is one of the most

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
prominent languages and it is the most

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
advanced language in the world.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It is not like that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Rather, the diversity of Arabic language

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
between literature, rhetoric, grammar,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
punctuation, beauty, expression, and multiple

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
languages makes some people afraid of learning it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
while it is one of the strong and easy languages

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to learn, but it only needs determination

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and persistence to learn and perfect it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Do you know why the Arabic language

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was named the language of pressure?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Yes, for sure.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This name is re-released on the Arabic language

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because it is the only language at the level

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of the world that contains the letter DAD.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And the teacher describes you as

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in love with the Arabic language.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Why?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
How can I not love it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The Creator has honored it and made it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the language of the Holy Quran and the language

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of the Master of Messengers, which is the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
language of the President and the cradle

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
of civilizations around the world.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Thank you for watching!
