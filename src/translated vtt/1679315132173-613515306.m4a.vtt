Dialect 2

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:12.660
Dearати Monica, can i ask your opinion regarding Arabic?

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.180
Of course reem, because i love this kind of dialogue.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
Good, when the Arabic language appeared in the world?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.420
The Arabic language has appeared

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.600
since long years ago in Jeddah,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.660
and the historians indicated

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.660
It is one of the top languages

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.660
and it is the group of the oldest languages in the world

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.660
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.660
It is not like that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
but the diversity of Arabic language sciences

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.660
between literature and communication

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.660
and grammar and grammar

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.660
and the beauty of the words and the expression

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.660
and the multiple singularities

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.660
make some people afraid of learning it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.660
while it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.660
but it only needs determination and persistence to learn and master it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.660
Do you know why Arabic is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.660
Yes, for sure

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.660
This name is re-used on Arabic

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.660
because it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.660
that contains the letter of the opposite

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.660
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.660
And the teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.660
Why?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.660
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660
The Creator has honored it

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.660
and made it the language of the Holy Quran

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.660
and the language of the Master of Messengers

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660
and it is the main language of Islam

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.660
and the cradle of civilizations around the world

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.660
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:18.660
Thank you, Yamuna
