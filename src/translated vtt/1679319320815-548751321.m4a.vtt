Muna's friend

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.800
My dear friend Muna, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.600
Of course Reem, because I love this kind of conversation.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.800
Okay, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.200
The Arabic language appeared many years ago

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.700
and the historians pointed out that it is one of the high languages,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.700
and it is the group of the oldest languages ​​in the world.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200
It's not like that.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700
Rather, the diversity of Arabic language sciences,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
between literature and communication,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.200
grammar and grammar,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
beauty and expression,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
and multiple singularities,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.700
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.700
it only needs determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Do you know why Arabic is called the language of the dead?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.700
This name is re-released on Arabic,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.700
since it is the only language in the world

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700
that contains the letter DAD.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.700
And the teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
Why?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
The Creator has honored it,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
and the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.700
and it is the main language of Islam,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.700
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:18.700
Thank you, Yamuna.
