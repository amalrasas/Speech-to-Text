00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In the Arabian language

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Of course Reem, I like this kind of conversation

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Good, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Arabic language appeared many years ago

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Historians pointed out that it is one of the most important languages

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And it is the oldest group of languages in the world

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why is learning the Arabic language so difficult?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It is not like that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The diversity of Arabic languages, from literature to rhetoric, grammar to grammar,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to the beauty of the words and the multiple singularities

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
make some people afraid of learning them

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
While it is one of the most powerful and easy languages to learn

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But it only needs determination and persistence to learn and master it

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Yes, of course

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This name is re-used on the Arabic language

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Because it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that contains the letter of the opposite

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Do you always get high marks in the Arabic language?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And the teacher describes you as a lover of the Arabic language

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Why?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How can I not love it?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The Creator has honored it, and made it the language of the Holy Quran

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And the language of the Master of Messengers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it is the main language of Islam

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And the cradle of civilizations around the world

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Thank you, Mona
