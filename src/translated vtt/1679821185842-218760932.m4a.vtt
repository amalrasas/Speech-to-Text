00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
A poem

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.400
amazed me with its beauty

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.400
My heart was overwhelmed as I wrote it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.400
It revealed my poem and motivated me to honor it

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.400
20 poems like this have wisdom

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
Don't thank people for their wounds, you are their companion

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.400
The wound hurts only those who have kindness

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
Complaining to people, oh people

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.400
is a loss, and those who are kind to it will be rewarded

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400
Worries are like a flood

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
Worries are like a flood and diseases are like a flood

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.400
The red of evidence, no matter how much you complain

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400
If you complain to those who have a good time

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Your eyes will boil and those who complain will have a sad face

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.400
And if you complain to those who complain, you will make them happy

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.400
You added a wound to your wound called regret

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Will the mediation one day free my country?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
Or is torture an alternative to death?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Those who regret their luck, turn off their eyes of concern

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Luck has no eyes if you don't see its concerns

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.400
How I was disappointed with those I gave my trust to

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.400
So it forced me to leave it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
How I became a bridge for those I loved

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400
So it crossed my path and how it lowered my feet

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.400
So my heart sank, and my heart was its destination

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.400
So what is the loyalty of a fool who has no values?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.400
Neither the despair of my clothes nor the diseases break me

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Neither the despair of my clothes nor the sorrows break me

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.400
My wound is stubborn, it is like a fire that burns

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.400
Drink your tears, drink your tears

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.400
And cut once a honey, the candles burn and they smile

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.400
And stick your nose and scratch its back like a mouse

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.400
And break like a sword, if the bones break

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.400
The justice of the earth is in the hands of those who are in it

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.400
And justice on earth is neither justice nor sin

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.400
So good is a good, good, bad, and evil is a bad, bad, and ungrateful wolf

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.400
All the bad things are in the hands of those who are in it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.400
To reassure the wolf that the sun is not set

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
Be a wolf and be a lion without a hand

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400
You see the delicacies under your hands, you are full

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:45.400
So the money is a gold coin, it has what the nations pray in all their languages

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.400
And the best of the best, pharaohs and most people under their thrones

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.400
They served me, I complain to you, I complain to you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.400
O you who are full of pain, their blood did not flow on the borders, their blood flowed

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
And who but Allah, we are strong under his chest

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.400
And we seek help from him and we hold on, be a philosopher

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:39.400
You see everyone here is fighting against a non-existence, and they are a non-existence
