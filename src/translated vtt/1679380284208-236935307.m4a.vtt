Question

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:26.720
Dear friend! Can I know your opinion about some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.720
The historians pointed out that it is one of the most famous languages, and it is the oldest group of languages in the world.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
Why is learning Arabic difficult?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720
It is not like that.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.720
The diversity of Arabic language sciences, including literature, rhetoric, grammar, grammar, grammar,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.720
beauty, expression, and multiple singularities, make some people afraid of learning them.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:02.720
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn, it only requires determination and persistence to learn and master it.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.720
Do you know why Arabic is called the language of the opposite?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720
Yes, of course.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.720
This name is re-used in Arabic, since it is the only language in the world that contains the letter of the opposite.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.720
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.720
The teacher describes you as a lover of Arabic.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.720
Why?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720
How can I not love it?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.720
The Creator has honored it, and made it the language of the Holy Quran,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
the language of the Master of Messengers,

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.720
the main language of Islam,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.720
and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
How beautiful is the Arabic language!
