The Arabic Language

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My dear friend Mona, can I know your opinion on some points related to the Arabic language?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Of course Reem, I love this kind of conversation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Good, when did the Arabic language appear?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The Arabic language has appeared for many years and historians have pointed out that it is one of the most famous languages and it is the oldest group of languages in the world.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Why is learning the Arabic language difficult?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It is not like that. The diversity of Arabic language sciences, including literature, communication, grammar, grammar, beauty, expression, and multiple singularities, make some people afraid of learning it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
While it is one of the strong and easy languages to learn, it only requires determination and persistence to learn it and perfect it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you know why the Arabic language is called the Dada language?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yes, of course. This name is re-released on the Arabic language, since it is the only language on the level of the languages of the world that contains the letter Dada.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you always get high marks in Arabic?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the teacher describes you as being in love with the Arabic language. Why?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:48.000
How can I not love it? The Creator has honored it and made it the language of the Holy Quran and the language of the Master of Messengers, the main language of Islam and the cradle of civilizations around the world.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:02:00.000
How beautiful is the Arabic language! Thank you, Mona.
